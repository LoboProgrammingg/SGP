# Project Summary
+ This project is a Simple Management System (SGP) built using Djangoâ€™s admin interface, with additional custom features such as filters and the ability to export selected products to Excel. The system provides an efficient way for team members to manage and download product data based on specific criteria. The layout and interface are designed using Django's template language and Jazzmin to create a user-friendly and modern admin panel. Although the system is relatively simple, it is comprehensive and rich in information, offering all the necessary tools for effective management.
